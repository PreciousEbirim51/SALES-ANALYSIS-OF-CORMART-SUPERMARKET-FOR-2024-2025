Pre-Analysis BoardI conducted a pre-analysis process on the dataset before analyzing the dataset on pivot chart. This pre-analysis involves breaking the dataset into meaningful components.
Project Split: The dataset was split into two variables which are independent and dependent variables and this helps in understanding the relationship between the data points and can provide hint on the type of insights that can be gotten from the dataset.
Potential Analysis/Questions: In this step, the questions that can be answered with the dataset were identified and it will serve as a bearing when the analysis starts proper.
Potential Insights: I was able too uncover some insights during this step just by observing the data split and it aided in my analysis by narrowing my focus on the important insights that can be gotten from the data set.
Storytelling: After the earlier steps described above, it became easier to tell a story from the dataset by relating the datapoints with each other.

RECOMMENDATION

I recommend more marketing campaign as the sales trend is currently declining in 2025 after a relatively flat 2024.
I recommend an active inventory monitoring on the stock levels of the products mostly purchased by the three different genders.
I recommend a more gender specific merchandising approach within the supermarket.
I recommend offering an incentive program for the repeat customers as this will encourage them and the new customers to patronize the supermarket.

CONCLUSION
Cormart Supermarket demonstrated low sales growth in 2024â€“2025, with a notable shift toward digital sales and high demand in electronics. Strategic pricing, promotions, and customer loyalty programs will play a crucial role in driving revenue.
